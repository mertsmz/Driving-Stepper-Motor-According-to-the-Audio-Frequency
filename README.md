# Driving Stepper Motor According to the Audio Frequency
The system indicates the frequency range of the noise in the room by using a LED with three colors and a stepper motor with three different speed levels. The frequency range and measured noise frequency are shown on NOKIA 5110 LCD screen. The project is written in Assembly language, and run on TM4C123GXL microcontroller board by using Keil uVision software.
